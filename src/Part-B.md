# Linking Test Package with Real Software

## Steps:
1. **Replace Stub with Real Implementation**: Update the test setup to use the real implementation instead of the stub. `system -> RealProjectManagment ` been created allready!
2. **Use the Interface**: Tests remain unchanged as they rely on the shared interface between the stub and the real implementation.
3. **Compilation**:
    - Tests donâ€™t require recompilation as they are already compiled against the interface.
    - Recompile the system only if the real implementation has been updated.



**In Summary**: No need to recompile tests, just ensure the interface is consistent and the real implementation is correctly linked.
